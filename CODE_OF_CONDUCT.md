# ZardUI Project Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we, as contributors and maintainers, commit to making participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sexual characteristics, gender identity and expression, experience level, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Graciously accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what's best for the community
- Showing empathy for other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Using sexualized language or imagery and unwanted sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Posting others' private information, such as physical or email addresses, without explicit permission
- Other Conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional environment.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and must take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instance of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to both project spaces and public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting through an official social media account, or acting as a designated representative at an online or offline event. Project representation may be further defined and clarified by the project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at gomesluiz.dev@gmail.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response deemed necessary and appropriate under the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident. More details on specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who fail to follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions, as determined by other members of the project leadership.
